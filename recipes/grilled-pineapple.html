    <p>Pineapple's taste is sweet. The already-juicy fruit becomes even juicier, and its sugars caramelize and char against the grill grates.</p>
    <p> You end up with grilled pineapple rings that are smoky, tart, tender, and sweet.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and cut into rings</li>
        <li>¼ cup canned coconut milk</li>
        <li>½ cup cinnamon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place the coconut milk and cinnamon sugar into separate dishes. Dip slices of pineapple into coconut milk, then coat in cinnamon sugar.</li>
        <li>Grill slices for 6 minutes on each side. Remove to plates, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
